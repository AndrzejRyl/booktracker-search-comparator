## Project Overview

This is a new React project bootstrapped with Vite. It appears to be a standard, unmodified template, ready for development.

- **Framework:** React 19
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Language:** JavaScript
- **Styling:** CSS (via `App.css` and `index.css`)

The entry point of the application is `src/main.jsx`, which renders the main `App` component located in `src/App.jsx`.

## Building and Running

### Development

To start the development server with hot-reloading, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` directory with the optimized and minified assets.

### Previewing the Production Build

To preview the production build locally, run:

```sh
npm run preview
```

## Development Conventions

### Linting

The project is configured with ESLint for code quality and consistency. To run the linter, use:

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Testing

**TODO:** No testing framework is currently configured. You may want to add a testing framework like Vitest, Jest, or React Testing Library.
