Please look at @CLAUDE.md to understand what type of project we're working on and look on all docs in @ai-specs.
Those are specs for previous features we were working on in this project and guidelines on how to build such specs.
Today we're going to build a new spec. We are ONLY building the spec. NO CODING PLEASE. NO RUNNING COMMANDS. Just simple
spec creation. Below you will find description of the feature we will be building spec for.
Please do investigate the current state of the code before proposing a solution. You can only read code, no changes.
